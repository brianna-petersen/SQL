# AppDataEntry
##My original code for a hypothetical food tracking app. 
##This project highlights my ability to update, alter, and delete data.

#The following table is for a food tracking app. The user can log the food or drink that they consume. The details include if it was at breakfast,lunch, dinner, or a snack, how much was consumed in grams and the corresponding amount of calories.

CREATE TABLE food_tracker ( 
    data_entry INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    food TEXT,
    meal TEXT,
    amount REAL,
    calories INTEGER);
INSERT INTO food_tracker (food, meal, amount,calories) 
VALUES
('Apple', 'snack', 10, 5),
('French Toast', 'breakfast', 50, 350),
('Sandwhich', 'lunch', 55, 467),
('Water', 'lunch', 42, 0),
('Carrots', 'snack', 20, 25),
('Burger', 'dinner', 70, 570),
('Soda', 'dessert', 20, 25),
('Chocolate', 'dessert', 5, 30);

SELECT *
FROM food_tracker;
#Updated the first entry from "Apple" to "Orange"
UPDATE food_tracker SET food = 'Orange', calories = 15 WHERE data_entry=1;

SELECT * 
FROM food_tracker;

#Added a column to measure satisfaction after each food item.
ALTER TABLE food_tracker ADD satisfaction INTEGER;
UPDATE food_tracker SET satisfaction = 1 WHERE data_entry = 1;
UPDATE food_tracker SET satisfaction = 1 WHERE data_entry = 2;
UPDATE food_tracker SET satisfaction = 0 WHERE data_entry = 3;
UPDATE food_tracker SET satisfaction = 1 WHERE data_entry = 4;
UPDATE food_tracker SET satisfaction = 0 WHERE data_entry = 5;
UPDATE food_tracker SET satisfaction = 1 WHERE data_entry = 6;
UPDATE food_tracker SET satisfaction = 0 WHERE data_entry = 7;
UPDATE food_tracker SET satisfaction = 1 WHERE data_entry = 8;

SELECT * FROM food_tracker;

DELETE FROM food_tracker WHERE calories = 0;

SELECT * FROM food_tracker;
